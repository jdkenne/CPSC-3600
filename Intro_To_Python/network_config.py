# TODO: Define a variable named 'config' that contains a dictionary with the entries
#       'packet_length', 'num_links', 'bandwidths', 'distances', 'transmission_speeds', 'processing_delays', and 'average_packet_arrival_rate'
#       These variables will contain all of the information we need to compute a packets round trip latency through a network.
#       'packet_length' should store the length of the packet in bytes
#       'num_links' should store the number of links the packet will pass through
#       the remaining entries should store lists of length 'num_links', where each entry in the list corresponds with the value associated with that link
